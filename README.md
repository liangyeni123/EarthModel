In this project, there are mainly two steps to carry on. The first step is sphere tessellation using triangle mesh to tessellate a sphere, while the second step is texture mapping. Adopt bump mapping to adjust sphere with an elevation earth map and implement the texture mapping of the earth model with an earth map. Then this project uses Phong illumination model, which includes three parts: global ambient reflection, per-light
diffuse reflection, and per- light specular reflection, to simulate the realistic directional light. At last, it uses night light map to make the rendered surface more realistic.
